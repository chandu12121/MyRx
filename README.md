## 1. Square and Sort a Sorted Array
Given a sorted array of positive and negative numbers, square each element and sort the array.

**Constraint:** Time complexity O(n)

### Example:
**Input:** `[-12, -8, -7, -5, 2, 4, 5, 11, 15]`

**Output:** `[4, 16, 25, 25, 49, 56, 121, 144, 225]`

## 2. Immutable Class Design
Design an immutable class with the following attributes:
- `String name;`
- `String Id;`
- `Date dateOfJoining;`
- `List<Address> addresses;`

---

## 3. Sort Red, Green, and Blue Balls
Given an array of Red, Green, and Blue balls, sort them in place.

**Constraints:**
- **Time complexity:** O(n)
- **Space complexity:** O(1)

### Example:
**Input:** `[R, G, B, G, G, R, B, B, G]`

**Output:** `[B, B, B, G, G, G, G, R, R]`

## 4. Minimum Platforms Required
Given two arrays representing the arrival and departure times of trains, find the minimum number of platforms required so that no train has to wait.

### Example:
**Input:**
```
arr[] = {9:00, 9:40, 9:50, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00}
dep[] = {9:10, 12:00, 11:20, 11:30, 19:00, 20:00}
```
**Output:** `3`
**Explanation:** At most three trains are at the station between `9:40 to 12:00`.

**Input:**
```
arr[] = {9:00, 9:40}
dep[] = {9:10, 12:00}
```
**Output:** `1`
**Explanation:** Only one platform is needed.

## 5. Sort HashMap by Value
Given a HashMap, sort it by values.

### Example:
**Input:**
```
Map: {101=John Doe, 102=Jane Smith, 103=Peter Johnson}
```

**Output:**
```
Map: {102=Jane Smith, 101=John Doe, 103=Peter Johnson}
```
